# Calendar App

This project is a web-based calendar application built with Next.js and TypeScript on the frontend and Express.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL on the backend. The goal of this project is to explore new technologies, implement best practices such as the SOLID principles, and add features to make the app more scalable, secure and efficient.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

The frontend of this project is built using Next.js and TypeScript. Next.js is a popular React-based framework for building modern web applications, while TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript to improve code quality and developer productivity. Other technologies used in the frontend include:

- React: a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- CSS Modules: a way to locally scope CSS styles to avoid naming conflicts and improve code maintainability
- Date-fns: a lightweight JavaScript library for manipulating dates and times

### Backend

The backend of this project is built using Express.js, TypeScript and PostgreSQL. Express.js is a popular Node.js-based framework for building web applications, while TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript to improve code quality and developer productivity. PostgreSQL is a popular relational database management system that provides scalability and high performance. Other technologies used in the backend include:

- TypeORM: an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) library for TypeScript that provides a higher-level API for interacting with the database
- Helmet: a middleware for securing HTTP headers and protecting against common web vulnerabilities

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and PostgreSQL installed on your local machine. You can then clone the repository and install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
