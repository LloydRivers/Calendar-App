# Modular Folder Structure for an Express Server with TypeScript.

When building an Express server that serves a calendar app with TypeScript, it's a good idea to aim for a modular code structure. Here are some tips on how you can make your Express server modular:

1. **Controllers**: Controllers should handle the business logic of your application. Each controller should be responsible for one specific feature of your application. For example, if you have a "users" feature in your application, then you should have a "usersController" that handles all user-related functionality.

2. **Routes**: Routes should define the endpoints that your application will expose to the clients. Each route should map to a specific controller. For example, if you have a "/users" endpoint in your application, then you should have a corresponding route in the "routes" folder that maps to the "usersController".

3. **Services**: Services should contain reusable code that is shared across your application. For example, if you have a "dateService" that performs date-related operations, then you can keep it in the "services" folder. Services should not have any dependencies on controllers or routes.

4. **Utils**: Utils should contain utility functions that are used across your application. For example, if you have a "loggerUtil" that logs messages to the console, then you can keep it in the "utils" folder.

5. **Models**: If your application uses a database, it is a good idea to keep your models in a separate folder. Models should represent the schema of your database tables and should be used by the controllers to interact with the database.
